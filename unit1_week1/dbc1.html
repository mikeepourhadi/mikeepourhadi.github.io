			This page is supposed to reflect all things me. At this, the very moment that I write this<br> sentence, I am learning how to write HTML more fluidly than I already do. Hopefully by the time<br> I complete this whole page, it will have some exciting things for you to look at.

	<h3 class="questions_p1">That sounds fun.</h3 class="questions_p1">

			Oh it <em>is</em>. It's a privilege to be able to contribute to such a cool collaboration. And meet some <strong>awesomely</strong> creative people!

	<h3 class="questions_p1">Favorite part?</h3 class="questions_p1">
		<p>
			Shows. Definitely playing shows - it's an experience like nothing else I've done. The single <strong>most</strong> exciting moment of my life was the first show I played. <a href="http://www.redlinetap.com/" target="_blank">Red Line Tap</a> is far and away my favorite venue.

	<h3 class="questions_p1">What else do you do?</h3 class="questions_p1">
		<p>
			I work at the Sheriff's Office of Cook County - human resources stuff. I actually coordinate the<br> internship program. Basically, I attend career fairs at various univeristies across Chicago trying to find interest and<br> talent. After that, I give an orientation to those who have been accepted and place them throughout the office. It can be<br> exhausting! But it's been a great time (with certain complications, of course) and it's an experience that I was extrememly fortunate to have.
