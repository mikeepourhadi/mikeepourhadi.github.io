		<div class="block">
				<ul class="content">
					<li><a class="emphs" href="http://www.fueled.com" target="_blank">Fueled</a></li>
					<li><a class="emphs" href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
					<li><a class="emphs" href="http://www.frankandoak.com/" target="_blank">Frank and Oak</a></li>
					<br>
						<p>I chose these websites because, to me, they present unique approaches to their various fields.</p>
						<br>
						<p>While <span class="emphs">FUELED</span> is a dramatically dynamic and purposeful site, <span class="emphs">FRANK AND OAK</span> is more simple and elegant, while <span class="emphs">TWITTER</span> remains more of a utility. Stepping back, however, each of these sites are strikingly similar: they each have one, unified, driving focus.</p>
						<br>
						<p>As I mentioned earlier, they are all strikingly different (as indeed they serve very different purposes. For instance, were I to explain Fueled visually, I would say something like:</p>
						<br>
							<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Elegant</li>
								<li>Unified</li>
								<li>Stunning</li>
								<li>Fluid</li>
								<li>Organic.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<br>
						<p>Whereas I would explain Twitter as:</p>
						<br>
							<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Simple</li>
								<li>Focused</li>
								<li>Static</li>
								<li>Restrained</li>
								<li>Clean.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<br>
						<p>And Frank and Oak as:</p>
						<br>
						 	<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Slick</li>
								<li>Blocky</li>
								<li>Design-Centric</li>
								<li>Colorful</li>
								<li>Dynamic.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<br>
						<p>I have to say, Fueled is by far the most entertaining of these sites to use. It has such an organic feeling, like every interaction between myself and it just makes sense. <span class="emphs">"</span>Oh, <span class="emphs">OF COURSE</span> I scroll that way for the overlay to activate.<span class="emphs">"</span> It has the general feeling that so many things are going on in the background to create what's going on. I love it.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Honestly, most of what I wanted to talk about is <span class="emphs">FUELED</span> and how much this damn wesbite makes me want to work there.
