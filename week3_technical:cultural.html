		<h2 class="titlehead">Saturday, <span class="emphsday">MARCH 30TH</span>: Pairing, caring </h2>
		<div class="block">
			<div class="content">
				<h3 class="emphstitle">LET'S CARE</h3><br>
				<p>I really <span class="emphs">REALLY</span> enjoy pairing. It's a unique feeling, and truthfully I was petrified to start.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="emphs">Do I know anything? Am I cut out for this at all?</span> Those were the thoughts in my head. See? Petrified.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="emphstitle">SO?</h3>
				<br>
				<p>It has been great. Pairing with another person is not only helpful, it's incredibly enlightening. The other students headed to DBC are brilliant, open-minded and helpful. And funny. And interesting. And diverse. All that good stuff. Building rapport in the first few minutes is a lot of fun, and then <span class="emphs">pairing is just having a conversation while sorting out a challenge. That's what I've loved so far.</span> I have yet to encounter frustrations: so far, I've worked with some awesome people and we've grown together.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="emphstitle">FEEDBACK. HMMM.</h3>
				<br>
				<p>I'm having a bit of a tough time with feedback. Reading my own feedback is fantastic: it provides insights into myself and how I work. Stuff that I wouldn't notice myself. That's what it's for. Right? I think so. Overall, the feedback has been helpful for me for no reason other than forcing me to focus - and forcing myself to adjust to the right habits. Be open about my lack of knowledge, be open about my weaknesses and accept them. That's another important bit. Accept my inadequacies. Accept my shortcomings. I will be more vocal.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="emphstitle">WRITING IT</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Writing feedback is hard. It's not just "oh yeah, Jim was AWESOME!" No. It's paragraphs of pertinent information for the aformentioned Jim to see his strengths and potential improvement areas. It's about showing someone that there is always a chance to grow via peaceful, nondestructive language. How can Jim improve? What was he great at? Be specific, he needs to know. What can he <span class="emphs">DO</span> next time?</p>
				<br>
				<p>It's difficult for me to be critical of someone. I always feel like I'm being a jerk to critique someone for something. Maybe we just have different preferences and he/she does things differently? Are my frustrations justified? These are the questions I ask myself, and what makes it difficult for me to write feedback. I want people to feel confident in their work and themselves.</p>
				<br>
				<p>But that's not the point. This is programming. There are ways to do things, syntax to remember and functions to create. Certain things need to be done a certain way - certain words and communication must happen. That's where feedback should come in. That's where it's important. It's to help, not deride. It's for growth - just like pairing. Everything works hand-in-hand. And it's pretty awesome.</p>

		<h2 class="titlehead">Saturday, <span class="emphsday">MARCH 30TH</span>: JS VS RUBES </h2>
		<div class="block">
			<div class="content">
				<h3 class="emphstitle">FIRST THING'S FIRST</h3><br>
				<p>I love JavaScript. </p><br>
				
				<p><span class="emphs">"Pff, that's dumb."</span></p><br>
				
				<p>You're dumb. JavaScript is amazing. But why? Let me explain through personal experience and growth - that will likely be the most helpful way of explaining my (*cough*) subtle opinion.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="emphstitle"> I LEARNED JAVASCRIPT FIRST </h3>
				<br>
				<p>And that's a super important detail. You see, the syntax for these languages have some strong similarities in the logic breakdown, but that's where it ends. JS is picky - it will yell and scream when you miss a semicolon, comma or bracket. And make no mistake, they're everywhere. JS is Goldilocks. Punctuation is the damn soup.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Ruby circumvents that issue. Ruby makes it much easier to power out some methods and hashes and arrays and etc etc. It's simpler and more user-friendly. At the very least, the syntax seems more focused towards ease of writing. <span class="emphs">And that completely threw me off. </span></p>
				<br>
				<p>I was so caught up in JS conventions that Ruby was a complete headache to learn and I almost threw a fit. Thank goodness I didn't.</p><br>
				<h3 class="emphstitle">LET'S RUBY BRAG</h3>
				<br>
				<p>I thoroughly enjoy writing loops in Ruby - and that's one of the strongest bits of the language that I have encountered thus far. All of the headaches of nesting, nesting, nesting, iterating, nesting that I had while interacting with JS are all but gone in Ruby. Honestly, it seems like Ruby was built to loop.</p>
				<br>
				<p>How about <span class="emphs">syntax</span>? Ruby is semantic. You know those enjoyably obvious HTML 5 semantic elements? Header, Footer, etc? Ruby has some incredibly semantic methods that a programmer can just guess.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="emphs" style="text-align: center">.is_a?</p>
				<br>
				<p>What does that do? It checks if something is a something. You see that? THE ANSWER IS IN THE DEFINITION. That's what semantic means, and that's something that Ruby does that JavaScript doesn't.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="emphs" style="text-align: center">.times</p>
				<br>
				<p>How about that one? This method does something _____ times. AGAIN. ANSWER. IN. DEFINITION. We're done here.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="emphstitle">BUT I LOVE JS</h3>
				<br>
				<p>I love client-side interactions. JS is great at that. jQuery is a beast at that. JavaScript makes pages interactive and graceful, and I'm a big, big fan. There's a veritable code revolution going on for our little misunderstood programming language, and I couldn't be more excited. Web pages are going to get more and more interesting and fun to interact with.</p></br>
				<p>In my experience so far, Ruby is better and heavy lifting and quick implementation. JS? JS is slow, focused and detail-oriented.</p>
