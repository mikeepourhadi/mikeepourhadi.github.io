						<p>While <span class="emphs">FUELED</span> is a dramatically dynamic and purposeful site, <span class="emphs">FRANK AND OAK</span> is more simple and elegant, while <span class="emphs">TWITTER</span> remains more of a utility.

						<br>
						<p>As I mentioned earlier, they are all strikingly different (as indeed they serve very different purposes. For instance, were I to explain Fueled visually, I would say something like:</p>
						<br>
							<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Elegant</li>
								<li>Unified</li>
								<li>Stunning</li>
								<li>Fluid</li>
								<li>Organic.</li>

						<p>Whereas I would explain Twitter as:</p>
						<br>
							<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Simple</li>
								<li>Focused</li>
								<li>Static</li>
								<li>Restrained</li>
								<li>Clean.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<br>
						<p>And Frank and Oak as:</p>
						<br>
						 	<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Slick</li>
								<li>Blocky</li>
								<li>Design-Centric</li>
								<li>Colorful</li>
								<li>Dynamic.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<br>
						<p>I have to say, Fueled is by far the most entertaining of these sites to use. It has such an organic feeling, like every interaction between myself and it just makes sense. <span class="emphs">"</span>Oh, <span class="emphs">OF COURSE</span> I scroll that way for the overlay to activate.<span class="emphs">"</span> It has the general feeling that so many things are going on in the background to create what's going on. I love it.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Honestly, most of what I wanted to talk about is <span class="emphs">FUELED</span> and how much this damn wesbite makes me want to work there.

		<h2 class="titlehead">Thursday, <span class="emphsday">MARCH 20TH</span>: TECH BLAG</h2>
		<div class="block">
			<div class="content">
				<p> <span class="emphs">JAVASCRIPT. FFFWHAT?</span></p>
				<br>
				<p>It's great. You know it. I know it - but a simple (and, uh, sort of blatantly obvious question) is why?</p>
				<p>Here are a few reasons:</p>
				<br>
				<ul class="emphs">
					<li>Ease to learn</li>
					<li>Functionality/Libraries</li>
					<li>It's expanding</li>
				</ul>
				<br>	
				<p><span class="emphsday">Alright. So here we go.</span></p>
				<br>
				<p>Easy is, I suppose, and outrageously subjective term. JavaScript isn't 'easy,' but then again, not many things are. It's all about the learning curve - can a thoughtful human being make heads or tails of something by looking at it. Well, yeah. For JavaScript at least.</p><br>
				<p>This is me, coming at you with some first hand experience. JS was the first language I decided to fiddle with, and I don't regret that for a second. <span class="emphs">Was it hard? Yeah.</span> Am I still in the dark about 'this'? Definitely. BUT, that's not the point. I learned it, and played with it and that knowledge helped me when I attempted to learn more complex languages, like Ruby.</p><br>
				<p>And that's what I'm saying. It's simple enough for a completely technologically inept human to pick it up and learn it. That also vastly increases user base, which will inevitably expand support, modifications and implementation. See? Ease to learn is a huge one.</p>
				
				<br>
				<p><span class="emphsday">NUMBER TWO</span></p>
				<br>

				<p>JavaScript is extremely potent. It's a black tea steeped for like 3 hours. A programmer can do a lot of heavy lifting with just a little bit of code, and it's stunningly functional. That's pretty unique - or at least it was - in terms of HTML and the web, so JS exploded pretty quickly.</p><br>
				<p>People loved it. Like right away, and that wasn't necessarily the best thing. It wasn't really completed, and to this day there are functions that developers don't use because they're broken. And that's where libraries come in.</p><br>
				<p>jQuery. I'll be honest, jQuery is the only library that I'm aware of and it's just fantastic. What jQuery is (and what libraries are for JS in general) a collection of elements from JavaScript that have been rewritten to be easier to use. Granted, that's a very, very high level description, so take it with a grain of salt. My main point is: <span class="emphs">libraries make JS easier to use</span>. Libraries clears away some of the strange bits and create a more specialized set of tools to further unlock the potential of JavaScript.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="emphsday">OH BOY, NUMBER THREE</p>
				<br>
				<p>I alluded to this way up in section one. JavaScript is growing. And not just as a language, either - more and more browsers are slinking in line to allow JS and it is becoming more and more ubiquitous. It's not a niche language anymore.<p><br>
				<p>What else? JS can be used client-side and server side, which allows it to pull data more efficiently. It has objects and allows for object manipulation as well as procedural execution for smaller projects. It's a swiss army knife, and developers keep finding new ways to manipulate it. It's nuts. It's awesome. Use it, but avoid the oil patches of broken-ness.<br>
				<p>Honestly, give it a shot. It's fun and interesting and powerful - what more could you want?</p>
