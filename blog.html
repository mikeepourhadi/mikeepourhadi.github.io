		<h2 class="titlehead">Friday, <span class="emphsday">MARCH 14</span>, '14: FAVORITE WEBSITES</h2>	
		<div class="block">
				<ul class="content">
					<li><a class="emphs" href="http://www.fueled.com" target="_blank">Fueled</a></li>
					<li><a class="emphs" href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
					<li><a class="emphs" href="http://www.frankandoak.com/" target="_blank">Frank and Oak</a></li>
					<br>
						<p>I chose these websites because, to me, they present unique approaches to their various fields.</p>
						<br>
						<p>While <span class="emphs">FUELED</span> is a dramatically dynamic and purposeful site, <span class="emphs">FRANK AND OAK</span> is more simple and elegant, while <span class="emphs">TWITTER</span> remains more of a utility. Stepping back, however, each of these sites are strikingly similar: they each have one, unified, driving focus.</p>
						<br>
						<p>As I mentioned earlier, they are all strikingly different (as indeed they serve very different purposes. For instance, were I to explain Fueled visually, I would say something like:</p>
						<br>
							<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Elegant</li>
								<li>Unified</li>
								<li>Stunning</li>
								<li>Fluid</li>
								<li>Organic.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<br>
						<p>Whereas I would explain Twitter as:</p>
						<br>
							<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Simple</li>
								<li>Focused</li>
								<li>Static</li>
								<li>Restrained</li>
								<li>Clean.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<br>
						<p>And Frank and Oak as:</p>
						<br>
						 	<p><ul class="emphs">
								<li>Slick</li>
								<li>Blocky</li>
								<li>Design-Centric</li>
								<li>Colorful</li>
								<li>Dynamic.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<br>
						<p>I have to say, Fueled is by far the most entertaining of these sites to use. It has such an organic feeling, like every interaction between myself and it just makes sense. <span class="emphs">"</span>Oh, <span class="emphs">OF COURSE</span> I scroll that way for the overlay to activate.<span class="emphs">"</span> It has the general feeling that so many things are going on in the background to create what's going on. I love it.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Honestly, most of what I wanted to talk about is <span class="emphs">FUELED</span> and how much this damn wesbite makes me want to work there.

		<h2 class="titlehead">Thursday, <span class="emphsday">MARCH 20TH</span>: TECH BLAG</h2>
		<div class="block">
			<div class="content">
				<p> <span class="emphs">JAVASCRIPT. FFFWHAT?</span></p>
				<br>
				<p>It's great. You know it. I know it - but a simple (and, uh, sort of blatantly obvious question) is why?</p>
				<p>Here are a few reasons:</p>
				<br>
				<ul class="emphs">
					<li>Ease to learn</li>
					<li>Functionality/Libraries</li>
					<li>It's expanding</li>
				</ul>
				<br>	
				<p><span class="emphsday">Alright. So here we go.</span></p>
				<br>
				<p>Easy is, I suppose, and outrageously subjective term. JavaScript isn't 'easy,' but then again, not many things are. It's all about the learning curve - can a thoughtful human being make heads or tails of something by looking at it. Well, yeah. For JavaScript at least.</p><br>
				<p>This is me, coming at you with some first hand experience. JS was the first language I decided to fiddle with, and I don't regret that for a second. <span class="emphs">Was it hard? Yeah.</span> Am I still in the dark about 'this'? Definitely. BUT, that's not the point. I learned it, and played with it and that knowledge helped me when I attempted to learn more complex languages, like Ruby.</p><br>
				<p>And that's what I'm saying. It's simple enough for a completely technologically inept human to pick it up and learn it. That also vastly increases user base, which will inevitably expand support, modifications and implementation. See? Ease to learn is a huge one.</p>
				
				<br>
				<p><span class="emphsday">NUMBER TWO</span></p>
				<br>

				<p>JavaScript is extremely potent. It's a black tea steeped for like 3 hours. A programmer can do a lot of heavy lifting with just a little bit of code, and it's stunningly functional. That's pretty unique - or at least it was - in terms of HTML and the web, so JS exploded pretty quickly.</p><br>
				<p>People loved it. Like right away, and that wasn't necessarily the best thing. It wasn't really completed, and to this day there are functions that developers don't use because they're broken. And that's where libraries come in.</p><br>
				<p>jQuery. I'll be honest, jQuery is the only library that I'm aware of and it's just fantastic. What jQuery is (and what libraries are for JS in general) a collection of elements from JavaScript that have been rewritten to be easier to use. Granted, that's a very, very high level description, so take it with a grain of salt. My main point is: <span class="emphs">libraries make JS easier to use</span>. Libraries clears away some of the strange bits and create a more specialized set of tools to further unlock the potential of JavaScript.</p>
				<br>
				<p><span class="emphsday">OH BOY, NUMBER THREE</p>
				<br>
				<p>I alluded to this way up in section one. JavaScript is growing. And not just as a language, either - more and more browsers are slinking in line to allow JS and it is becoming more and more ubiquitous. It's not a niche language anymore.<p><br>
				<p>What else? JS can be used client-side and server side, which allows it to pull data more efficiently. It has objects and allows for object manipulation as well as procedural execution for smaller projects. It's a swiss army knife, and developers keep finding new ways to manipulate it. It's nuts. It's awesome. Use it, but avoid the oil patches of broken-ness.<br>
				<p>Honestly, give it a shot. It's fun and interesting and powerful - what more could you want?</p>

		<h2 class="titlehead">Thursday, <span class="emphsday">MARCH 22ND</span>: CULTURAL BLAG</h2>
		<div class="block">
			<div class="content">
				<p><span class="emphsday">NUMBER ONE : VALUES.</span></p><br>
				<p>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</p>
				<br>
				<ul class="emphs">
					<li>Adventure</li>
					<li>Friendships</li>
					<li>Music</li>
					<li>Romance</li>
					<li>Challenge</li>
					<li>Achievement</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>So I picked a few of these. I'll expound (word? <span class="emphs">BAM GOOGLE : </span>"present and explain (a theory or idea) systematically and in detail.") on one.
				<br><br>
				<h3 class="emphsday">Music</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Cop out? Perhaps. I've been a musician of some sort or another for most of my life: oboe, handbells and now drums. Drum set, specifically.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I joined a band two years ago, and it quickly became the highlight of my existence. Songwriting is simply the most blissful experience I've ever been part of. Get this: sitting, with friends, maybe a beer, and arranging otherwise individual and disconnected noises into a 'song.' And then putting some words over the noises to tell a story that we can all relate to. FOR NOTHING - and that last bit is an important part. <span class="emphs">It's art for art's sake.</span> It's a collaboration that I have never felt before. EVERYONE can do it. That's also what makes it so special. It's for everyone. SO GIVE IT A SHOT.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="emphsday">Uh... let's move on.</p> 
				<p class="tiny">sorry.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="emphs">Back to that list.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I'm going to rate them according to how much I try to live up to them. 1-5. One being I suck, five being 'whoa boy, look at me living up to my values.' Sound good? Alright. Okay.</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Adventure - 3</li>
					<li>Friendships - 3</li>
					<li>Music - 5</li>
					<li>Romance - 3</li>
					<li>Challenge - 4</li>
					<li>Achievement - 3</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p class="emphsday">Do people ask you for advice?</p>
				<br>
				<p>Sometimes. The last time someone asked me for advice was about a life decision, a job change. He, being a young twenty-something out of college, asked me which job he should take. Here's the rundown:</p>
				<br>
				<p class="emphs">One job paid well, but he didn't care for it. The other? He loved the work, but it didn't pay well. And it was in California.</p>
				<br>
				<p>"Go to California." That's what I said, and I don't regret it. He hasn't moved yet, so it could go poorly. But it will have been the right choice. I know it, and so does he. He will learn so much more about himself and his life, following his dreams and shunning the temptations of comfort and money. He's an astonishing person, and he deserves happiness. And that doesn't come with money.</p>
